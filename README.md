Zoo tracjer is an application which allows to keep track of animals by recording their info, adding, editing, piping.

## Planning
1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Angular CLI version 1.1.0
  * Bootstrap v3.3.7

2. Specs
  * Animal will be added by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
  * Animals will be displayed on homepage
  * User will be able to edit animal's info
  * User will be able to to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (more than 2 years of age).

3. Potential future functionalities
  * Save animal data to database.
  * Add custom styling.
  * Group animals into categories.
  * Show animals based on diet
  * Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day.
  * Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.

4. UX/UI
  * Install and use Bootstrap

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
